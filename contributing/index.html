    </div>

    <ol class="description">

      <li> Look through the existing issues and see if your idea is something new. </li>
      <li> Create a <a href="https://github.com/yargs/yargs/issues">new issue</a>, or comment on an existing issue that you would like to help solve:
        <ul>
          <li> it's usually best to get some feedback before proceeding to write code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li> fork the yargs repo, and clone it to your computer:
        <ul>
          <li> GitHub has <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">great documentation</a> regarding writing your first pull request. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li> make sure that you write unit-test for any code that you write for yargs:
        <ul>
          <li> we use <a href="https://github.com/feross/standard">standard</a> coding style, which will validate your style when you run tests </li>

          <li> look through our extensive test suite in <a href="https://github.com/yargs/yargs/issues">/test</a> to get an idea for how to write unit-tests for this codebase. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li> make sure you are comfortable with the Code of Conduct outlined below. </li>
