# Yargs 4.0 is Here

I'm excited to announce that yargs 4.0 is here and it's a big update!

There were a few major goals that I had this update:

1. fix some long standing API inconsistencies.
2. improve support for commands (this feature always felt phoned in).
3. modularize more of yargs' components.
4. begin moving yargs into an organization.

## Breaking Changes

There a few breaking changes that you should be mindful of as you
upgrade from yargs 3.x to yargs 4.x:

### **.help()**

When called with no arguments in 3.x, help would return a string representation of
the usage string that yargs would output. This felt inconsistent with
other API methods (`.env()`, `.completion()`) which instead configure a
default key when invoked with no arguments.

Calling `.help()` with no arguments will now default to enabling help
when `--help` is passed to your CLI application.

### **.command()**

There has been a major overhaul to the command API (which I will be discussing
  in [its own section](#new-command)).

### **.version()**

`.version()` took its arguments in
the opposite order to other API methods: the `version`, followed by `key`.

`.version()` now takes arguments in an API consistent order: `key`, followed by `version`. Calling version with no arguments will now default to using the `--version` key,
and outputting the version # in your `package.json`.

### **.strict()**

strict mode will now require that any commands executed have been
registered using `.command()`.

### Fancy Pants New Features

### **.pkgConf(key, cwd)**

The new `.pkgConf()` feature allows you to specify that yargs should load
default configuration values from a key in your package.json, e.g.,:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">
  require('yargs')
    .pkgConf('nyc')
  </code>
</pre>

Would load the default `reporter` value from:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-json">
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "nyc": {
      "reporter": "lcov"
    }
  }
  </code>
</pre>

### **Configure yargs Parsing Features**

You can now turn on and off the following parser settings in yargs:

* _short-option-groups_
* _camel-case-expansion_
* _dot-notation_
* _parse-numbers_
* _boolean-negation_

To do so create a yargs stanza in your project's package.json:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-json">
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "yargs": {
      "short-option-groups": false,
      "boolean-negation": false
    }
  }
  </code>
</pre>

See the [Configuration section](https://github.com/yargs/yargs-parser#configuration) of the
_yargs-parser_ project, for more information about these various parsing settings.

### **.number('foo')**

The new `number` type has been added to yargs, this works similar to `string` and
`boolean`.

## Commands 2.0

Commands always felt a bit clunky in yargs, I would find myself creating a lot of
boiler-plate code for each command that yargs handled.

yargs 4.x includes several updates to help solve this problem:

### **Named Positional Arguments**

When creating a command you can now specify _optional_ and _required_ named
positional arguments:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">
  yargs.command('get &lt;source&gt; [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request')
    .help()
    .argv
  </code>
</pre>

These positional arguments will be populated in `argv`, like so:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">
  {
    "_": ["get"]
    "source": "the-source-you-entered",
    "proxy": "the-proxy-address-you-entered"
  }
  </code>
</pre>

### **Builders and Handlers**

For building a _command-driven_ interface, yargs now allows you to
specify a _builder_, and a _handler_:

_builders_ allow you to specify what arguments a sub-command
should accept:

_handlers_ will be invoked with the parsed _argv_ object.

This design makes it easy to pull your sub-commands into their own module:

**my-module.js:**

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">
  // my-module.js
  exports.builder = {
    banana: {
      default: 'cool'
    },
    batman: {
      default: 'sad'
    }
  }

  exports.handler = function (argv) {
    // do something with argv.
  }
  </code>
</pre>

**my-bin.js:**

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">
  yargs.command('get &lt;source&gt; [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help()
    .argv
  </code>
</pre>

### **Global Options**

_Globals_ are a final addition designed to make commands less redundant, you can now
specify that options should be _global_. Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like `help()` and `version()` default to being
global. What does this mean?

If I write:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">
  yargs.command('get &lt;source&gt; [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help()
    .argv
  </code>
</pre>

Calling:

`my-bin get --help`

will return help specific to the `get` command, without me needing to specify this.

## Yargs is More Modular

As part of the move to yargs 4, yargs is now much more modular:

* [yargs](https://github.com/bcoe/yargs) - yargs core.
* [yargs-parser](https://github.com/yargs/yargs-parser) - the part of yargs that actually parses argv.
* [y18n](https://github.com/yargs/y18n) - yargs' i18n library.
* [cliui](https://github.com/yargs/cliui) - yargs' CLI layout library.

## Yargs is Moving Into An Organization

One final big _big_ announcement, I'm excited to let you know that yargs' is being
moved into an organization. What does this mean?

There is now a beautiful new website which [Irina Shestak](https://github.com/lrlna) has
been leading development on:

[http://yargs.js.org/](http://yargs.js.org/)

The yargs' libraries are being moved into a GitHub organization (say hello to our core contributors):

[https://github.com/yargs](https://github.com/yargs)

[James Womack](https://github.com/jameswomack) and [Chris Dickinson](https://github.com/chrisdickinson) have helped create a beautiful logo for the organization, you should buy stickers!

[yargs laptop stickers](https://www.stickermule.com/marketplace/tags/yargs)

In an effort to ensure that yargs is a project that is inviting to
new developers, and creates a safe environment for folks to work in, a
contributor's code of conduct has been added:

[http://yargs.js.org/contributing/](http://yargs.js.org/contributing/)

Thank you to everyone who has made the yargs project possible, I couldn't
be more excited about the future \o/
