# yargs 5.0.0 Released

_yargs 5.0.0 is currently published to the `next` tag. To try it out simply
 type the following:_

<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">npm cache clear; npm i yargs@next --save</code></pre>

This release is an exciting one: we've both introduced several slick new
features (command suggestions, option coercion); and taken the opportunity presented by a major release to cleanup
inconsistencies with yargs' underlying API.

## New Features

### Recommended Commands

I love how git's command-line-interface provides helpful suggestions when
you accidentally type the wrong command:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-bash">git: 'comit' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
	commit</code></pre>

With the new `recommendCommands()` method, you can add this same functionality
to your yargs applications:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">require('yargs')
  .command('hello', 'hello command')
  .command('goodbye', 'goodbye command')
  .recommendCommands()
  .argv</code></pre>

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-bash">$ ./cli.js helo

Commands:
  hello    hello command
  goodbye  goodbye command

Did you mean hello?</code></pre>

### Option Coercion

yargs allows you to provide a `type` parameter for your options, hinting how the value
should be interpreted, e.g., `array`, `boolean`, `string`.

This works great for simple values, but folks routinely ask for more complex
parsing options; as an example, people have asked for the ability to parse
JSON:

<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">$ ./cli.js -j '{"message": "hello world!"}'</code></pre>

yargs' new coercion feature allows you to apply an arbitrary
parsing function to your options:

<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript">var argv = require('./')
  .option('j', {
    alias: 'json',
    coerce: function (arg) {
      return JSON.parse(arg)
    }
  })
  .argv

console.log(argv.json.message)</code></pre>

<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">$ ./cli.js '{"message": "hello world!"}'

hello world!</code></pre>

I love the concept of coercion, it gives our users much more flexibility
when parsing their arguments; without adding any significant complexity to
yargs itself.

## Breaking Changes

yargs 5.0.0 introduces several breaking changes, read carefully!

### Fixes to Command API

yargs' [command API](https://github.com/yargs/yargs#commandcmd-desc-builder-handler) is a great way to build a complex nested command
line application; in a nutshell, it allows you to decompose your
command line application into individual commands, helping with the
separation of concerns:

<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript">require('yargs')
  .command('foo', 'foo command', function (yargs) {
    // builder function, receives a yargs instance
    // which you can use to add command-specific options.
  }, function (argv) {
    // handler function, called once parsing is complete.
    console.log('foo')
  })
  .command('bar', 'bar command', {}, function (argv) {
    console.log('bar')
  })
  .argv</code></pre>

**slick!**

Commands are one of yargs' most complex features, and we continue
to iterate on their API; we've made the following command-related breaking changes
in this release:

* **[default help command added](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/pull/574)**: you can now
  simply type `./cli.js help`, to receive yargs' help output.
* **[changes to `demand()`](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/pull/582)**: `demand()` now properly
  handles being invoked relative to a command; before this fix, the command itself would cause
  constraints to be applied incorrectly.
* **[`builder` no longer requires yargs to be returned](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/pull/549)**: The third
  argument to `command` is a builder for describing options specific to the command. The builder command no longer requires that you
  return a yargs instance. Simply interact with the yargs instance passed as the first argument, and your options
  will take effect.
* **[`builder` now defaults to noop builder](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/pull/583)**: the builder
  now resets all yargs configuration settings that are not flagged as being [`global`](https://github.com/yargs/yargs#globalglobals).
* **[global `fail`](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/pull/583)**: the `fail()` method now applies globally. This means that
  you can define a `fail()` handler once on the top-level yargs object, and nested failures in commands will bubble up to it.

### Tweaks to Parser

[yargs-parser](https://github.com/yargs/yargs-parser) is the underlying engine that
processes the strings passed into  [`process.argv`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_argv).

We've made a couple breaking changes to the parser in this release:

* **[we now handle negative numbers](https://github.com/yargs/yargs-parser/pull/44)**: prior to
  this release negative numbers were interpreted as numeric options, with this
  release you can now pass negative numbers as values to options: `-number -123`.
* **[fixes to option groups](https://github.com/yargs/yargs-parser/pull/19)**: a bug has been
  fixed with option groups (`-abc`) terminated by numeric values (`-abc123`).

### Miscellaneous

* **[fixed name of Chinese locale](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/pull/511)**: we've renamed
  zh.json to zh_CN.json

## What's Next

The biggest thing currently on the core team's mind is documentation. The [yargs README](https://github.com/yargs/yargs) has grown unwieldy! we have some plans in the
works to help solve this problem:

* over the next few months expect to see targeted tutorials popping up on the yargs
  website; the first of which will likely be on the topic of commands.
* we've also created a [gitter.im chatroom](https://gitter.im/yargs/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) where folks can get help using yargs from its core contributors.

Hope you enjoy all the exciting updates in yargs 5.0.0!
