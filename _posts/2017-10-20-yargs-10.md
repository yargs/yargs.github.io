# yargs 10 Released

_wow, I just noticed it's been over a year since I wrote about a release of
yargs. I'm excited about `yargs@10` and I hope you'll find it's been worth
the wait._

Commands are my favorite feature in yargs, they let
you quickly hammer-out a CLI-application addressing both the
problem of flow-control and human-readable help output:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">require('yargs')
  .command('append &lt;w1&gt; &lt;w2&gt;', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {}, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add &lt;n1&gt; &lt;n2&gt;', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {}, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv</code></pre>

Even though I love the feature, I had a couple major beefs with the API:

* I like the [positional argument DSL](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/advanced.md#positional-arguments) (`<foo>`, `[bar]`, etc.), but positional
  arguments were missing many of the features available to flag arguments:
  you couldn't set their type, configure a coerce method, etc.
* there was a major disconnect between how you described the root-level
  entry-point to your application and the subcommands that your application
  accepts. `.usage()` hadn't ever been updated to reflect a world in-which
  commands exist.

The goal of `yargs@10` was to address the above issues.

## .positional(&lt;name&gt;, &lt;options&gt;)

The new [`.positional()`](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/api.md#positionalkey-opt) method allows you to provide the same parsing hints
for positional arguments that you could already provide for flag arguments.
Let's look at an updated version of our example application:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">require('yargs')
  .command('append &lt;w1&gt; &lt;w2&gt;', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('w1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    }).positional('w2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add &lt;n1&gt; &lt;n2&gt;', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('n1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    }).positional('n2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv</code></pre>

To provide parsing hints for positional arguments, simply use the method
`.positional()` in your command's [builder function](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/api.md#commandmodule). Positional arguments
now go through the same parser that parses flag arguments and behavior
will be identical.

## .usage(&lt;cmd&gt;, [description], [builder], [handler])

If you provide more than one argument to the [`.usage()`](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/api.md#usagemessagecommand-desc-builder-handler) method, `.usage()`
now acts as an alias for a [default command](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/advanced.md#default-commands). This allows you to configure a command
that runs as the main entry-point to your application.

Let's look at an example:

<pre>
  <code class="hljs language-javascript">require('yargs')
  .usage('$0 &lt;name&gt;', 'say hello', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('name', {
      describe: 'the person to say hello to',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.info(`hello ${argv.name}`)
  })
  .argv</code></pre>

You can now use the same powerful command DSL for
describing the root-entry point to your application as you use for subcommands!

## Upgrading

There have been a couple breaking changes in this release:

* `.usage()` previously accepted an object as a second argument, treating this
  as an alias for `.option([obj])`.
* the API for defining hidden options has been made more explicit; rather than
  a falsy description representing a hidden option, the configuration value
  `hidden: true` should be set.
* help is now only shown if `help` is the last positional argument.

For a complete list of changes, see our [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

I hope you like what `yargs@10` has to offer,
